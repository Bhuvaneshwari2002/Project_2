🥗 NutriClass: Food Classification Using Nutritional Data

📘 Project Overview:
This project aims to classify various food items into categories based on their nutritional attributes such as calories, protein, carbohydrates, fat, sugar, and fiber.
It uses machine learning models to automatically predict food categories, supporting health and dietary applications.

🎯 Objective:
To develop a multi-class classification model that accurately identifies food types based on their nutritional profile.

🧠 Skills & Technologies Used:

Programming: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Concepts:

 * Data Cleaning
      
 * Feature Engineering & Encoding
      
 * Data Normalization/Scaling
     
 * Model Training & Evaluation
      
 * Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance Visualization
  

🧩 ML Models Implemented:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Tree

3. Random Forest

4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

6. XGBoost

7. Gradient Boosting Classifier

📊 Evaluation Metrics:

Each model was evaluated on:
 * Accuracy
 * Precision
 * Recall
 * F1-Score
 * Confusion Matrix

🏆 Results:

After comparison of all models, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, demonstrating that the dataset is largely linearly separable.
Tree-based models like Gradient Boosting also performed well but showed slight overfitting without parameter tuning.

🧾 Project Deliverables:
   - Jupyter Notebook (NutriClass_Food_Classification.ipynb)
   - Dataset (synthetic_food_dataset_imbalanced.csv)
   - Visual results and insights

💡 Conclusion:

The NutriClass model successfully classifies food based on nutritional data and can be extended for smart dietary recommendation systems, meal planning apps, or nutrition tracking platforms.
